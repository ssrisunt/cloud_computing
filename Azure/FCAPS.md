# FCAPS - Best Practice on Network Monitoring

[LINK@AzureDocs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/network-fundamentals-2/5-network-monitoring)

When you manage a network, you deal with many different tasks and functions.

These tasks and functions have been categorized to help us do them effectively.

- __Fault Management__: Relates to the processes and tasks used to identify and resolve faults on the network. Dealing with issues that might cause problems later is also classified as fault management.
- __Configuration Management__: Includes aspects like collecting information based on changes made to the configurations of devices, physical hardware, and network changes, as well as software updates.
- __Accounting/Administration__: Applies when you're dealing with a network used in a service provider setting, and all the tasks and functions that apply. With service provider networks, usage needs to be monitored to track utilization and billing for users. If the network isn't in a service provider setting, then administration is applicable, and tasks like managing permissions and user passwords are included.
- __Performance Management__: Covers anything that's done to manage the performance of your network. Aspects include monitoring throughout, monitoring usage, and improving response times.
- __Security__: Encompasses all the tasks you do to secure your network. These tasks include protecting devices, restricting access to network resources, or protecting user activity in the network.
