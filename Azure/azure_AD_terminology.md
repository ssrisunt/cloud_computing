| Custom domain        | A domain that you customize for your Azure AD directory. When you create an Azure AD directory, Azure automatically assigns it a default like `<your-organization>.onmicrosoft.com`. But you can customize domain names. Your users could then have account like `joesmith@contoso.com` instead of `joesmith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com` |
| Owner role           | The role you use to manage all resources in Azure, including the access levels that users need for resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Global administrator | The role that gives you access to all administrative capabilities in Azure AD. When you create a tenant, you automatically have this role for the tenant. This role allows you to reset passwords for all users and administrators, for example.                                                                                      |
